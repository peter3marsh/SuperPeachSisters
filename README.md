This is a Super Mario Bros emulator created for the purpose of extensive practice in object oriented programming!
In one of my courses at UCLA we put together this emulator and I've kept it to this day because it's still fun to make new levels for and play. 
I feel like it's a great intersection between my love for gaming and coding.
